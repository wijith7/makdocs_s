# Introduction

**WSO2 Updates** include any improvements (e.g., bug fixes, security
fixes) that are released by WSO2 on top of a released WSO2 product
version. With updates, you do not have to wait until the next product
version is released to get the fixes you want. Find out more about WSO2
updates at <https://wso2.com/updates>.

You can get updates using WSO2 in-place updates or WSO2 update
manager. The following table shows the key differences of the two:

| WSO2 in-place updates                                                                          | WSO2 update manager (WUM)                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You can install the in-place updates tool via a WUM update for all the WUM-supported products. | You can download and install the WUM tool from <https://wso2.com/wum/download/>.                           |
| The tool merges the updated configuration files unless there are conflicts.                    | You should manually merge the updated configuration files or use a tool like Puppet.                       |
| The tool handles backup and restore.                                                           | You should store backups with the custom configurations in your system, in case you have to restore later. |
| Supported on only Unix-based (e.g., Linux, OS X) operating systems.                            | Supported on all operating systems.                                                                        |

A subscription is mandatory to get WSO2 updates. A subscription can be
one of the following types:

-   Free Trial Subscription: Provides all the functionality of a paid
    subscription for 14 days. The validity period can be extended.

-   Paid Subscription: Can discuss your specific requirements with a
    WSO2 accounts manager and set up a subscription via a channel.Here
    are the available channels:

<!-- -->

-   -   **Full**: This is the default channel. It gives all updates
        including bug fixes, security fixes, and improvements.

    -   **Security**: Gives security bug fixes only.

    -   **Premium**: A custom channel that is only accessible to
        a particular customer (i.e., company). This channel gives access
        to specific updates as requested by the customer.
